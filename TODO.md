# Action Plan for webhook-proxy Development

## Project Description
A proxy service for receiving webhooks and forwarding them to multiple configured destinations, with detailed logging of each step.

## Main Components
- HTTP server for receiving webhooks
- Proxy manager for forwarding webhooks
- Configuration system for defining endpoints and destinations
- Logging system for recording events

## YAML Configuration File Structure
```yaml
server:
  port: 8080
  host: "0.0.0.0"

logging:
  level: "info"
  format: "json"
  output: "stdout"
  file_path: "/path/to/log/file.log"

endpoints:
  - path: "/webhook/github"
    destinations:
      - url: "https://destination1.example.com/webhook"
        headers:
          Content-Type: "application/json"
          X-Custom-Header: "custom-value"
```

## Code Architecture
- `cmd/webhook-proxy/main.go`: Application entry point
- `config/`: Configuration management
- `logger/`: Logging system
- `server/`: HTTP server
- `proxy/`: Proxy manager for forwarding webhooks

## External Dependencies
- HTTP Framework: Chi
- Logging: logrus
- Configuration: viper or yaml.v3

## Development Plan

### Phase 1: Basic Configuration and HTTP Server ✅
- [x] Create project structure
- [x] Configure logging system
- [x] Implement basic HTTP server
- [x] Create simple proxy manager
- [x] Replace Gin with Chi

### Phase 2: Configuration and Validation ✅
- [x] Implement YAML configuration parser
- [x] Create data structures to represent configuration
- [x] Add configuration validation
- [x] Allow loading configuration from environment variables
- [x] Add unit tests for configuration
- [x] Create example configuration file

### Phase 3: Proxy Improvement and Error Handling ✅
- [x] Add retry mechanism for failed destinations
- [x] Implement timeout management
- [x] Add metrics to monitor performance
- [x] Improve error logging
- [x] Add unit tests for proxy
- [x] Add endpoints for metrics and health

### Phase 4: Documentation and API ✅
- [x] Create openapi.yaml file at the repository root to document the API

### Phase 5: Code Quality and Tooling ✅
- [x] Add golangci-lint for code linting
- [x] Configure linting rules adapted to the project
- [x] Fix existing linting issues

### Phase 6: Deployment and Distribution
- [x] Configure GoReleaser for binary creation
- [x] Create Dockerfile for containerization

### Phase 7: Continuous Integration
- [x] Configure GitHub Actions for continuous integration
- [x] Add workflows for automated tests
