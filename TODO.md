# Action Plan for Webhook Proxy Development

## Project Description
A service that receives webhooks and forwards them to multiple configured destinations, with detailed logging of each step.

## Main Components
1. HTTP server to receive incoming webhooks
2. YAML configuration manager
3. Routing system to forward webhooks
4. Comprehensive logging system
5. Error handling and retry mechanism

## YAML Configuration File Structure
```yaml
# Example structure
server:
  port: 8080
  host: "0.0.0.0"

logging:
  level: "info"  # debug, info, warn, error
  format: "json" # json, text
  output: "stdout" # stdout, file
  file_path: "/var/log/webhook-proxy.log" # if output is file

endpoints:
  - path: "/webhook/github"
    destinations:
      - url: "https://destination1.example.com/webhook"
        method: "POST"
        headers:
          Content-Type: "application/json"
          X-Custom-Header: "value"
        timeout: 5s
        retries: 3
        retry_delay: 1s
      - url: "https://destination2.example.com/webhook"
        method: "POST"
        timeout: 3s
        retries: 2
  
  - path: "/webhook/gitlab"
    destinations:
      - url: "https://destination3.example.com/webhook"
        method: "POST"
```

## Code Architecture
- `main.go`: Application entry point
- `config/`: Package for configuration management
- `server/`: Package for HTTP server
- `proxy/`: Package for webhook forwarding logic
- `logger/`: Package for logging system
- `models/`: Package for shared data structures
- `utils/`: Package for utility functions

## External Dependencies
- HTTP Framework: Echo or Gin
- YAML Parsing: gopkg.in/yaml.v3
- Structured Logging: zap or logrus
- HTTP Client: standard or resty

## Development Plan

### Phase 1: Project Structure Setup
- [ ] Initialize project structure
- [ ] Configure dependencies
- [ ] Create README.md with initial documentation

### Phase 2: Configuration
- [ ] Implement YAML configuration parser
- [ ] Create data structures to represent configuration
- [ ] Add configuration validation

### Phase 3: HTTP Server
- [ ] Set up HTTP server
- [ ] Implement handlers for configured endpoints
- [ ] Add HTTP error handling

### Phase 4: Logging System
- [ ] Configure logging library
- [ ] Implement logs for received webhooks
- [ ] Implement logs for forwarded webhooks

### Phase 5: Webhook Proxy
- [ ] Develop webhook forwarding mechanism
- [ ] Implement retry handling
- [ ] Add support for custom headers

### Phase 6: Testing and Documentation
- [ ] Write unit tests
- [ ] Write integration tests
- [ ] Complete documentation
- [ ] Add usage examples

### Phase 7: Deployment
- [ ] Create Dockerfile
- [ ] Add startup scripts
- [ ] Prepare configuration examples

## Future Features (v2)
- Authentication for incoming webhooks
- Payload validation (JSON schema)
- Web interface for log visualization
- Queue mechanism for handling load spikes
- Advanced payload transformations
- Rule-based webhook filtering
- Metrics and monitoring (Prometheus)
